# sqldump

A utility program that can be pointed at a database and list of tables, and create sql scripts that will insert all the data found in the table.

It is still in a Beta stage, where it is functional but has somewhat limited configuration functionality. The schema of the configuration json files may slightly change between versions, until it's decided on a final schema for the 1.0 release.
